# format-commit

Easily format and standardize your commits for all your javascript projects using Git.

## Installation

```sh
$ npm i format-commit --save-dev
```

## Usage

In the scripts part of your package.json file add a new line `"commit": "format-commit"` and use `$ npm run commit` to commit your changes with format-commit.

Or install format-commit globally to use directly `$ format-commit` command .

The first time you use the command within your project, format-commit will ask you some questions to configure your commits and create a configuration file `commit-config.json` at the root of your project.

If you want to change format-commit configuration without manually editing the json file you can run the command `$ format-commit --config`.
